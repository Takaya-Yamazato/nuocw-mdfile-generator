### Course Overview

This is one-semester long discussion-based seminar course. Students work in teams to research specific topics of interest and present them in class.

The aim of this course is to widen students' perspective on biology-related issues.

The course is centered on several themes connecting biology with other sciences and social issues.

The course will provide practice opportunities to organize and present one' s viewpoint, and debate it at an open forum. Special emphasis is given to teamwork skills development and ability to provide feedback in a respectful manner.

One more integrated experience in this course is reading a book on a theme connecting biology with society (books provided by course instructor), and developing a book review to present in class.










### Course Requirements
This course is officially open to 1st-year G30 students from Science, Engineering and Agriculture.

### Textbooks
No textbooks are required for this course

### Further details on course structure and content
A. In-class discussions and presentations structure:<br>
For each class meeting students will be separated in groups randomly.<br>
Each group will choose a topic within the theme designated for the class. Students are expected to do a research on the theme before hand and come prepared with one or several possible topics to work on. The actual topic is a choice of the group, below are only suggestions.<br>
Groups are given 40 minutes to agree on a topic and brainstorm it.<br>
Final goal: to prepare an informative presentation.<br>
The presentation can be in any form the group finds appropriate, including but not limited to slides presentation.<br>
Time limit for presentation: 15 min. (In case of presentation slides: Aim at max10 slides.)<br>
Presentation Structure:<br>
-	Title (state clearly the topic)<br>
-	Main part (information on the topic, presented in logical sequences; objectively presented opposing opinions; references to the source of information)

B.Themes and suggested topics<br>
(The topics are just to give a few ideas; any other topic within the theme is welcome)<br>
1.  Biology and Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Math<br>
–How discoveries in Chemistry/Physics/Engineering/Math have shaped Biology
research direction (discovery of microscope, X-rays etc.)<br>
–How technology has changed the way we look at or make discoveries in Biology<br>
2. Biology and Arts<br>
-How visual arts have contributed to the knowledge of Biology (ancient
Egyptian/Greek sculptures and anatomy of human body, are anatomical drawings/
exhibits a form of art?)<br>
-Our senses are filters of our ability to perceive the world around us – what
implication this brings on art forms?<br>
-How literature has been representing biology? What we can learn about biology
from science fiction?<br>
3. Biology and Media<br>
–How biological research is misrepresented on media and the effect this has on our
lifestyle and life-long decisions; what knowledge/training in Biology do journalists
have?<br>
–Evolution – how science is interpreted, its relation to religion and society<br>
-How much of the history of science are we exposed to – political history has changed
hot spots of scientific research (Greeks, Ancient China, Islamic world, Europe, US
etc.), yet we hardly hear about names of scientists outside the “western world”.<br>
–The science of marketing – emotions and branding; brands are taping into customers’
emotions – how do they do that and why it works (limbic system/dopamine system
and emotions, how this relates to entertainment)?<br>
4. Biology and Politics<br>
-Has politics anything to do with biology?<br>
-Has politics anything to do with agriculture?<br>
-How contemporary political maps have been shaped by biological phenomena?<br>
-How government policies have changed the way we grow – and consume – our
food?<br>
5. Biology and Ethics<br>
-What the philosophical notion of ethics has to do with biology? Or doesn`t?  <br>
-Where religious or cultural ethics/customs crashes with biological principles? What
do we do (or do not do) to resolve it? Examples: heterosexuality, first-kin marriages,
cannibalism, use of experimental animals in science and pharma etc. <br>
6. Biology and Environment <br>
–Environmental issues and economics <br>
–Biodiversity and why it matters <br>
–Is there really any global warming and do we really have to be concerned? <br>
7. Biology and Sex <br>
–Biology of sex and culture of sex – same or different? What are the differences? <br>
–Hormones and libido <br>
–Sex is in the brain, perceptions of male and females – consent, abuse, porn <br>
–Objectifications and rape – the culture, the perceptions, the history; what we do to
stop that? <br>
–Ovarian cycle and contraception, how do different methods of contraception work?<br>
–Abortion – what is controversial about it and why?<br>
–Biological explanation of love – and lust – are they the same or different?<br>

### Grading
Group and individual presentations form 40% of total grade for the course; individual participation in discussions is 40% of final grade, individual book review is 20% of final grade.
