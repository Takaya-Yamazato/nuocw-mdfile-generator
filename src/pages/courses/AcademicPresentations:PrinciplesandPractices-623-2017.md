 ### 目的と目標 The main purpose of this course is to help students create longer and more sophisticated research presentations. Lessons will address the content and structure of professional-level academic presentations as well as strategies for successful delivery, including slide design, speaking style, and body language. The course will have an active learning environment, and students will be expected to participate enthusiastically in group work, class discussion, and presentation feedback activities. The instructor will provide guidance and support throughout the presentation design process. In their presentations, students will make a logical argument about a topic related to their majors or any academic field of interest. They will reference information from at least four academic articles about their topic and critically evaluate claims in their sources. Because students are required to use academic articles as sources, we will devote an early class to reviewing how knowledge is constructed and expressed in these texts. Students will give two presentations: one that introduces their topic and research questions (approximately 5 minutes) and one that contains their complete logical argument (approximately 10 minutes). When giving presentations, students will be expected to use notes rather than reading from a script. ### 履修条件あるいは関連科目等 Graduate students in any field are welcome to take this course. Students must be able to communicate effectively in English (student presentations, class discussions, and short lectures will be conducted entirely in English).
