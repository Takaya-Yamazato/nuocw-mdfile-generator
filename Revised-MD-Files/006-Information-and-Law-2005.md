### Key Features

For this subject, it is important that students participate fully in the lectures. Because there is not a substantial amount of teaching materials available for students' self-study, and because this class requires a large amount of basic knowledge, this course puts importance on lectures. The main objective of this course is to provide students with the ability and perspective to grasp the problems concerning our information-oriented society, which typically involves a wide range of laws, including civil law, criminal law and constitutional law.

For this, I will not just be choosing problems that have been widely looked at, but will also explain basic sociological and philosophical theories for examination and understanding. Students should be able to then think about the future and legislation while constantly acquiring knowledge on the existing legal system.

The style in which the lessons are conducted limits evaluation methods to exams. To judge students' abilities to think logically and express their own opinions, I took care in choosing questions that require them to write long opinions on general problems.

### Course Aims

In this course, students will;

1. acquire precise knowledge about the current legal issues surrounding our information-oriented society
2. develop various ways of thinking about theories on our information-oriented society
3. learn how to carry out a theoretical analysis on society
4. acquire a certain amount of knowledge about information technology

### Textbooks

None. Teaching materials will be distributed.

### Course Requirements and Recommended Courses

This course does not involve the handling of any information or network devices, so it is not necessary to have learned how to use them.
