!['Behavioristics Lecture II -Psychology of Industries and Organizations'](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/64/home_kanai.jpg)

### Key Features

1. To give students an image of the many events in the industry, I added many examples and also some actual experiences by the students themselves.
2. I used articles from newspapers and such to introduce as many up-to-date social topics as possible.
3. I had the students share each other's ideas by having them speak up in class.
4. At the end of each lesson, the students are given a sheet of paper on which they can write comments and ask questions freely. Along with giving me an idea of their comprehension and their interests, it helps me adjust the course composition accordingly.
