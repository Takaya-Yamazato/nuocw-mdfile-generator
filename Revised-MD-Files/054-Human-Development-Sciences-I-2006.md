description: >-
  University courses do not give you certain predetermined knowledge but allow each of you to train your own point of view, showing you various ways of looking at things. In particular, areas of study such as education, which deal with human beings and attempts interfering and one-way approaches towards them, never provide definite answers to show clear cause and effect. In that sense, in this introductory course, I as a lecturer will give you one of the points of view and will always ask you for your own thoughts on the subject. Asking you to consider your own point of view, I hope to interest you in the contents of this course.

### Key Features

University courses do not give you certain predetermined knowledge but allow each of you to train your own point of view, showing you various ways of looking at things. In particular, areas of study such as education, which deal with human beings and attempts interfering and one-way approaches towards them, never provide definite answers to show clear cause and effect. In that sense, in this introductory course, I as a lecturer will give you one of the points of view and will always ask you for your own thoughts on the subject. Asking you to consider your own point of view, I hope to interest you in the contents of this course.

### Course Requirements and Recommended Courses

This class is aimed at those who are willing to learn about the relationship between education and society, and those who are trying to consider their own way of living.

### Contents

This course consists of two parts: one is to socially and historically analyze the school education system, especially the concept of schools as the modern system of national education, which you have already experienced, and its way of viewing human beings; the other is to consider the idea, constructed through this system, of human character, and the collapse of that same idea. Besides this, you will consider the present problems of personality disorder, while contemplating how people think of themselves in this new society.

### Textbooks

- Makino Atsushi, <cite>&ldquo;Lifelong Learning and the Reconstruction of &ldquo;I&rdquo;&rdquo; </cite>(Daigaku Kyouiku Shuppansha (University Education) Publishing, 2005)

### Reference Books

Suitable materials will be introduced during the lessons.

### Note

Students are expected to make it a habit to take the questions posed in class and think about them by themselves.
