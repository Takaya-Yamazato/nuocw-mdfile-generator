![Tracing the History of Mei-Dai](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/57/home_haga.jpg)

### Key Features

This course is what is commonly called "Study of School History" and is held by the University's Literary Resources Room (abbr. LRR/ Curator: Shoji HAGA).

This type of lecture was first held in 1999. At first, it was held under the name, "The Universities of Japan- Present-day Japan and Nagoya University", but as the curriculum was revised in the 2003 school year, so was its name, rechristened to "Tracing the History of Mei-Dai".

Presently, this course is held in the first period of the school year, and, as a large-scale lecture, accepts some 200 to 250 students each year.

Many original teaching materials created by the LRR are used- including 'History of Mei-Dai' booklets- and some short videos- and help keep the lessons from being a 'listen-only' lecture.

The Booklet of Nagoya University's History series (11 books presently in print) is not a typical historical description book, but rather a simple description of the school's history from several different viewpoints. Being popular with many people inside and outside of this university, the book can be viewed on paper or on the web. In addition to the booklet, the website also offers two videos, "The History of Nagoya University – the campus (25min. approx.)" and "Nagoya University's Toyoda Lecture Hall (20min. approx)".

Also, at the end of each lesson, we ask students to turn in a simple report paper, providing a chance to ask questions, make requests, and so on.

### Course Aims

Do you know about the history of Nagoya University? In this course, you will have an opportunity to learn about our school's history. At the same time, through viewing the history of Japan's universities as an historical existence, broaden your views on the future of the university.

Today, many universities are undergoing a massive makeover. The execution and evaluation of these changes are impossible without historical knowledge of the university, its past and present. This course offers not only an opportunity to think about how universities like Nagoya should be, but also better understanding about the school where are all studying at now.

Conditions and recommended courses: None

### Contents

This course is divided into two sections. The courses will be arranged in order according to the following themes.

#### Serial section

While going over the history of Japan's college education from an institutional point of view, we will study the general history of our University.

1. Adoption of western education and construction of Japan's college education system – The roots of Nagoya University

2. The birth of The first universities and their development – From a medical school to "Nagoya Imperial University"

3. Appearance of high school education and its development – The affiliate schools of today's Mei-dai

4. Formation of today's university system – From "Nagoya Imperial University" to "Nagoya University"

5. Post-war reformations in universities – Nagoya University as it is now.

#### Individual section

By setting individual themes for each lesson, we aim to look into Mei-dai's history from a different perspective, and, at the same time, provide an opportunity to discuss future views. For textbooks we will use the "Booklet of Nagoya University's History" series (11 books).
