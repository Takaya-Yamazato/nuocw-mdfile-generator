### Key Feature

Until recent decades, archaeology meant researching periods of history about which document do not remain, like the Jomon period, the Yayoi period, or the Kofun period. Since the Asuka period, document history was seen as the preferable path of historical restoration, because the descriptions of authenticated histories like "Chronicles of Japan" had considerable reliability. So the field of study called historical archaeology had been considered what we call a supplementary study.

In recent years, however, the increase of finds by excavation and the development of research on historical features and artifacts have been remarkable. Particularly, things not usually contained in documents, such as ancient local aspects or what the ancient handicraft industries were like, when viewed from industrial economic history, make the results of archeology such that they are not possible to disregard.

In this course, I will highlight the true state of local government, how handicraft industry in the Ritsu-Ryo period was managed and so on, using archaeological methodologies like typological research, in order to get the most information from artifacts. I think that we may get closer to the true state of the Ritsu-Ryo society by combining the research results of archaeology and the results of document history.

### Course Requirements

No special requirements, although it is better if you have basic knowledge of Japanese history learned in high school.

I recommend that you take the course "Ancient Nation and Handicraft Industry" provided by Professor Furuoya.
