![Exploration of Japan: From the Outside Looking In](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/22/home_ukiba.jpg) 


### Key Features

Nagoya University has over 1200 international students. At the same time more and more students are going abroad through exchange programs from our university. Therefore, in this class we intend to deepen students' understanding of Japan through collaborative work of students from various cultural backgrounds. Also, we encourage students to consider what it means to them to be in a society where various people with different cultural backgrounds are living and cooperating with each other. We will also think about how multiculturalism can be achieved in our society. 

#### Experiential learning

Study abroad experience is full of inspiring and surprising happenings, and is also psychologically intensive experience. This course will give you an opportunity to experience "cultural gaps," or what it is like to be in a different culture. We will prepare a couple of intercultural simulation games, which will offer you some insights to look into various challenges of study abroad experience. 

#### Good chance to meet with international students

All the international students here are now experiencing what it is like to go abroad and study. Therefore for those who are willing to go abroad for exchange programs, it is going to be a valuable experience to be in contact with international students and think about cultural gaps you might face in the future. In this class, Japanese and international students will share the learning experience. The language used in this class is Japanese. Therefore, Japanese students have an important role to explain difficult terms with easy words. The number of students will be limited to about 30 people, including 15 Japanese and 15 international students. 

#### Group projects

In this course, we will discuss various issues in Japanese society or culture with in small groups. It is eye-opening experience for Japanese students to think about Japan from different cultural perspectives. For example, frequently asked questions are 'why do Japanese people like comic books?' or 'Why are there a lot of people sleeping in the subway?'. Of course there a lot of possible answers for these questions. However, the important part of this class is to experience the process of integrating opinions into the final presentation through discussion with your group members and to understand the importance of communication. 

#### Class organized by several professors

Several professors are responsible for organizing this course. They will be attending most of the sessions to perceive students' responses to various issues given in the course and give feedback from different perspectives. We also recognize that the significance of collaborative teaching which allow us to maximize students' learning by communicating each other regarding contents of each session.

<p>
We divide our class into several groups for group presentations. Only the next two sessions will be used for the preparation of presentations, so it is important to also prepare outside of the lecture. Therefore, after this class I would like you to decide on a theme, meeting time and what each of the group members will be working on to get ready for the presentation.
