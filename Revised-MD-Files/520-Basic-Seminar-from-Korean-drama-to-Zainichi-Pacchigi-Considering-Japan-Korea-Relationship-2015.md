### Course Overview

A topic that is harder to understand than Korean culture itself, is the actuality of Koreans living in Japan.
There are many reference materials discussing the issue, but reading them alone cannot deepen our understanding.
Therefore, we are inviting students from Tohsyun Korean Elementary school in Kasugai, and having students attending this seminar guide them around the university campus.
Also, we are inviting alumni of Korean schools and Koreans studying in Japanese universities to talk about their school life, career choices and their struggles over identity.
By seeing the real condition of Koreans living in Japan, we should be able to realize how biased the media coverage on them is.

### Key Features

**Using Familiar Themes to Approach Culture Differences.**

This course begins by deconstructing the symbolic images of "South Korea","North Kore" and "Zainichi Korean" (Korean Japanese people). Then, we will closely look at the similarities and differences between Korean and Japanese cultures, starting from familiar themes such as food culture, human relationships, romantic relationships, and entrance exam preparations. Therefore, I will frequently use TV dramas, movies, and programs that introduce Korea and the Zainichi Korean people as course materials.

### Course Contents

1. Lecture and Discussion (Please refer to Class Schedule)
2. Usingthe library and internet to search for materials and references.
3. Group presentations using Power point.

### Course Aim

For people living in Japan, South Korea (Chousen=Pre-divided Korea) is a curious country which is "very similar" but "different" from Japan. In this course, we will examine what makes South Korea (Chousen=Pre-divided Korea) strange for us Japanese people, and also look at ourselves in the mirror from South Korea's (Chousen=Pre-divided Korea) point of view. Further, as a way to approach the deep historical relationship between Japan and South Korea (Chousen=Pre-divided Korea), this course aims to deepen our understanding of Zainichi (Korean Japanese) people living in Japan.

### Course Activity

Active participation such as asking questions and discussing one's opinions is expected.

### Textbook

N/A. Printouts will be distributed as needed.
