### Course Overview

This is a seminar in the Socratic tradition. That means the teacher will not simply deliver lessons. Instead each student will read material, and then everyone will discuss it so that we can understand new ideas.

The class will be held in English. However, we will not study about the English language. We will use English as a tool for learning about society and social change. Use English as much as you can during class discussions and in your presentations.

You must complete the reading before class. When you come to class, you should be prepared to talk about the themes in the reading for the week. Everyone will have a chance to ask questions, share opinions, and learn from one another.

In addition, groups of students will work together on a presentation about a social issue. Your presentation will be based on a book you read about an issue you choose.

Outside of class, you will work on your own independent project. You can choose a recommended project that interests you, or you can create your own project, suitable to your own interests and the English skills you want to improve.

### Course Aims

The aim of this course is to help students acquire a deeper understanding of social and cultural issues through the point of view of contemporary English-speaking societies. Participants study various subjects through English language materials and discuss these issues in small groups. By working in small groups participants develop a basis for deeper understanding of the norms and practices of English-language scholarship, and develop communication abilities appropriate for participation in a university setting.

### Key features

The course works primarily through group discussion, together with readings on a broad range of topics. Students read materials before class, and then discuss their ideas and opinions so that everyone can understand new ideas. This not only gives participants opportunities for reading and speaking in English, but also challenges them to formulate and communicate their own ideas, and to understand the ideas of other participants.

Students work in small groups to create a presentation on a social issue of their own choosing. Students choose a non-fiction book to read and discuss in a small group. The group then works together to present both the main ideas of the book and their reactions to the book for the other seminar participants.

Each student also completes an independent project. Students can select an independent project that meets their own interests as well as the specific language and study skills they wish to improve.
