### Key Features

Unfortunately, this is a lecture concerning forest management and utilization in which most of the Bioenvironmental Sciences third grade students express little interest, so I am teaching by trial and error every year in order to increase interest, introducing new knowledge every year to maintain freshness. In this lecture, I sort out the present conditions and topics of forest management and utilization, giving consideration to the circulation of the progress of current research. I hope that, through this lecture, every student will acquire not only knowledge indispensable in jobs concerning forests, but also the sense of how forests should be treated.

1. In order that this does not become a one-way lecture, the following points should be kept in mind:

- There are practice exercises every lecture in which all students must participate.
- Students should study in advance for the next lesson using the textbook.
- Changing from a one-way lesson that simply enumerates knowledge, to a vital lecture which makes students think.
- Students have the chance to express their own opinions.
- There are debates at least once a semester.

2. I perform the following, in order for students to become interested in the lecture:

- Using visual aids such as DVDs and photographs, so that students will feel closer to the topic.
- Giving examples related to the lecture, so that it does not become monotonous.
- Narrowing the themes in one lecture in order for students to acquire deeper knowledge through a combination of preparation, lecture and review.
- Handouts will be given out, but these do not cover all slides of the power points used in the lecture.
- Students must therefore take notes.
- Important points will always be written on the blackboard.
- Students must sometimes answer questions in class.
- Students are evaluated by the final examination.
