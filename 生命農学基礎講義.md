### 授業ホーム
<p>Although lipids are used by humans since ancient times, they were studied only through the nineteenth century by scientists, probably because they are difficult to separate and identify. Lipids are one of the three main classes of food, along with carbohydrates and proteins, and are responsible for storing energy that animals do not immediately need.</p>

<p>This course is focused on oil chemistry with respect to the utilization of natural resources.</p>

<p>Students will learn;</p>
<ol>
<li>Basics of lipid chemistry including nomenclature, chemical structure etc.</li>

<li>Production of lipids from natural products including plants, animal, fish and microorganisms.</li>

<li>Modification of oils and fats for commercial product by chemical means.</li>

<li>Modification of oils and fats for commercial product by biocatalysts such as lipases.</li>

<li>Application of lipid-modifying enzymes for non-lipid compounds.</li>
</ol>
